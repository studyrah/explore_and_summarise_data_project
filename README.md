NOTE: Resubmitting following review comments, only the 'Final Plots ans Summary' section has changed (all 3 plots).

========

The chosen data set for my project was the 'white wine data set' as suggested by Udacity and thus not included in submission

(https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fudacity-hosted-downloads%2Fud651%2FwineQualityWhites.csv&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFUg-OvPk4mpLlkpW94LVA-BGpRlA)


All of the required files can be found in the 'project' sub-directory, these include

1. white_wine_eda.rmd - The RMD file
2. white_wine_eda.html - The Knitted html file
(additionally there are two .png files ggpairs-all.png and ggpairs-high.png, these are very expensive to generate so I pre-generated them)
3. Data set not included (as discussed above)
4. References.txt - List of websites etc. referred to

Please note that Knitting is rather slow, primarily due to the extensive use of geom_smooth
